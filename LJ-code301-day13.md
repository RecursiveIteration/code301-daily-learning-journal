# Code 301 - Day 13

Yesterday in Code 301 we spoke a lot about app deployment.  Stephanie demonstrated deploying her vet-manager app to Heroku.  In the process she set up a psql database and set the necessary remote local variables to access the database.

We then duplicated that process in lab, setting up the kilovolt database on Heroko and additionally setting a local variable for our github tokens so that we could access the Github API from Heroku's site deployment.
