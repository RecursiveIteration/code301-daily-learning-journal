# Code 301 - Day 8

Yesterday in Code 301 we continues our exploration of back-end development.  We used middle-ware functions from the 'body-parser' module to capture 'body' data from http query requests and used that data for creating SQL requests on the back-end.  We also talked a lot more about local variables in our shell environment and how to use them to store passwords and private keys so that we can access them anonymously in our code with the 'env' property of the JS 'process' object: ie: process.env.MY_KEY.
