# Code 301 - Day 1

On the first day of code 301 we began by discussing different development styles: Agile vs Waterfall.  We then spoke a little about the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for designing software with user interfaces.  We discussed:
  * Media Queries
  * Flexible Layouts
  * Viewports
  * Flexible Media

  After that we switched to a discussion of CSS and the principles of Mobile-First development.
