# Code 301 - Day 5

In Friday's class Stephanie created a 'Diary' application using JQuery and Handlebars.  She created a form in the webpage where a user could add data to populate a diary entry. She set it up so that an entry 'preview' would update as the user entered the form data.  The data in the 'preview', as well as the completed diary entries were rendered into the webpage using a Handlebars template.
