# Code 301 - Day 15

In code 301 on Friday we broke into our project groups and got started developing our ideas.  We decided to develop a pair-making application that will create matches within an organization.  Our base app is intended to create 'lunch dates' to help different members of an organization meet one another.  We plan to extend the functionality of the app as time permits to accommodate different scenarios like differing group sizes, new people entering the organization, old members leaving, etc.
