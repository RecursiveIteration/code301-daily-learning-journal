# Code 301 - Day 3

Today in Code 301 we revisited the tree selection game and replaced the sections of code where DOM elements were introduced with javascript commands with new JQuery commands. The JQuery commands introduced some optimizations such as allowing us to put event listeners directly on the images as opposed to having them placed on the containing element and capturing them as they bubbled up.
